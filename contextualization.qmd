## eDNA Metabarcoding Solutions and Applications

Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding is a revolutionary approach to biodiversity monitoring. By analyzing DNA fragments found in environmental samples such as water, soil, and sediment, we can identify species present in an ecosystem without the need for direct observation or capture.

### Applications

-   **Biodiversity Assessment**: Identify species in terrestrial, aquatic, and marine environments.
-   **Impact Monitoring**: Monitor the effects of environmental changes, pollution, and habitat destruction.
-   **Conservation Planning**: Inform conservation strategies by assessing species presence and population dynamics.
-   **Invasive Species Detection**: Early detection of invasive species to prevent ecological damage.

Our technology provides accurate, reliable, and non-invasive monitoring, making it a valuable tool for environmental management and conservation efforts.
